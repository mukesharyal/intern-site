# 🌐 Intern Site made with ReactJS

This is a static web app built with **ReactJS** that pulls data via an external **JSON API** and displays job listings in a clean, manageable format.

Each listing includes keywords that are **clickable**, allowing users to add them to a filter. The app can filter job listings based on the selected keywords, making job discovery easier and more focused.

This project was developed by me as part of an **internship application**. It required creating a simple but functional web app. It was also my first exposure to **React**, where I learned just enough to make the app work effectively. 🚀
