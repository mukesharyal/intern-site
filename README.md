# Intern Site made with ReactJS

This is a static web-app created with ReactJS that pulls JSON through an external API and posts them in a manageable format. The data is job listings for different positions posted at different points in time. There are keywords available in each job and they are clickable so that the keywords are added to the filters. The app is capable of filtering the job listings with the particular filters.

It was created by me when applying for an internship in a company, which required to create a working sample of a little web-app. This was when I learnt a bit of React (how much was required for making the app work) for the first time.
